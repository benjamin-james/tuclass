* Features
Type in your class names to get the book links on Amazon and the University of Tulsa bookstore, and double click on the links to open them up in your web browser to compare prices.

If you include the correct section number, it will make a schedule with the building and room number to find your classes.
In the past, I took a screenshot of [[file:http://selfservice.utulsa.edu][selfservice.utulsa.edu]] and using [[file:https://gimp.org/][GIMP]], I added on the building and room numbers. I felt that this application may be of some use to other people, so I made it.

If you have any comments, bug reports, or feature requests, please tell me. Shoot me an email at [[file:mailto:benjamin-james@utulsa.edu][benjamin-james@utulsa.edu]] or send a Pull Request for this repo.
